    `When I was a teenager in Myanmar, my uncle lent me his install CD for 
    Ubuntu 10.04. It was love at first install, and Linux and Open Source 
    software have since led me to pursue a career in software engineering, 
    with a focus on all things web.`,
    
    `Aside from coding, I enjoy immersing myself in music, especially through 
    audiophile headphones, and getting my soul’s fill of beautiful film and 
    anime. You can read my thoughts on these and other things on my personal 
    blog (coming soon to a browser near you).`
